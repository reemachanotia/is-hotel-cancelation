Project Overview
Hotel booking cancellations can significantly impact hotel revenue management and operations. Predicting cancellations helps hotels to optimize their booking strategies and manage resources more effectively. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict hotel booking cancellations based on a variety of features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Hotel Booking Demand Dataset from Kaggle. It contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes the following features:

Hotel type
Lead time
Arrival date
Length of stay
Number of adults, children, and babies
Meal type
Country of origin
Market segment
Distribution channel
Reserved room type
Assigned room type
Booking changes
Deposit type
Customer type
ADR (Average Daily Rate)
Special requests
Reservation status (canceled or not)
Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/reemachanotia/is-hotel-cancelation
cd hotel_booking_cancellation_prediction
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the EDA phase, we analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies or missing values. The EDA includes visualizations and summary statistics.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into meaningful features that can be used in machine learning models. In this project, we create new features and encode categorical variables.

Modeling
We experiment with various machine learning models to predict cancellations, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost
We use techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Evaluation
We evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. We also perform a detailed analysis of the model's strengths and weaknesses.

Results
The final model achieves an accuracy of X% and an AUC of Y%. The results indicate that feature A, feature B, and feature C are the most important predictors of booking cancellations.

Conclusion
Predicting hotel booking cancellations can help hotels improve their operational efficiency and revenue management. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in solving real-world business problems.

Future Work
Future work could include:

Integrating more features such as customer reviews and social media data.
Exploring advanced models like neural networks.
Implementing a real-time prediction system.
